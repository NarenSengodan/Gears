This is an example of a LLM which is not generic but definite towards one topic

The earlier versions was about universities now its about self-help coz "nobody is ready to help others" (jk jk)

The API right now is lLama-2 g
GUI _ Streamlit
langchain 
..etc..

How it works:-

When requsted a answer to llama-2 about any topic, it actually answers-given if it contains profane language or racial slurs-but the final answer is contrived with python by using certain list of keywords
to be checked in the question and answer of llama-2. If nun contain the keyword the hard coded output of it being out of topic is triggered.

Updated on MAY 20 2024 TO better API
